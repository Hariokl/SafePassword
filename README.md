This project has 2 apps:
   1) Stores in a convienent and accessable way all your Accounts and Passwords for different Services, where you can easily find and copy pre-processed password for app 2
   2) The only function of this is to get fed with a pre-processed password and spit out post-processed password which will be used for service's account from app 1

*This is just a beggining stage of this project, so any other information(like how I want it to look) is missing, but soon after I will complete this project

*This project is not supposed to be something grand, it's just project for my own amusement and safety, all your/mine passwords and data are stored only localy, and to make it more safe(in regards that data can be lost), I will add a .txt (or enother format) near an app (or if you click in app in settings to create file) of all your passwords&accounts&services to store in somewhere digital where you think it can be safe and not be lost 

You can use only app 1, as its function is intuitive designed organiser for your passwords, I just want to use it with app 2 for more security, so my passwords can be something complicated for accounts, while storing it in a simplier form 
{For example, I may have simple password for github "harioklGithub" (which will be stored in app 1), but when processed through app 2 it will look like: "JiraA4kGl)rfV" (this password will be used for github account}

CURRENT PROGRESS: working on app 1

CURRENT VERSION: to find version of an app, go to: "/build/Debug" and download all of it's contents for it's work

SOURCE CODE: is located in "/src", currently all code is in one file "main.cpp", later on it may change
