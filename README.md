This project has 2 apps:
   1) Stores in a convienent and accessable way all your Accounts and Passwords for different Services, where you can easily find and copy pre-processed password for app 2
   2) The only function of this is to get fed with a pre-processed password and spit out post-processed password which will be used for service's account from app 1

*This is just a beggining stage of this project, so any other information(like how I want it to look) is missing, but soon after I will complete this project

*This project is not supposed to be something grand, it's just project for my own amusement and safety, all your/mine passwords and data are stored only localy, and to make it more safe(in regards that data can be lost), I will add a .txt (or enother format) near an app (or if you click in app in settings to create file) of all your passwords&accounts&services to store in somewhere digital where you think it can be safe and not be lost
